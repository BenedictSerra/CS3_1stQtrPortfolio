# **5 EASY TOPICS** 

 ## 1. Loops 
  I believe that loops was a subject that I know very well. This is due to my prior experience in CS2 where it was mostly centered on loops in the latter part of the quarter. Loops are also very fun to code, and my favorite loop is the for loop.

## 2.  Variables 
  I believe I know the subject of variables very well. Like loops, variables are a essential part to coding, and without them, you wouldnt be able to make a code. In both cs2 and cs1 we already learned variables and this is why it was very easy in CS3.

## 3. Scope 
  Scope is a subject related to variables. Basically what scope is is where you can use that specific variable or function. I know this very well because of my CS tutor and it really isnt that hard to find the scope of a specific function or variable.

## 4. Conditional Statements 
  Conditional statements for me was the easiest subject of CS3. Like variables, we learned it in CS2 and in CS1 and the syntax is not different for javascript. If, else if, and else statements were also very straightforward.'

## 5. Function Declaration #
  I believe function declaration was a really easy topic as it is only 1 syntax that you need to remember. We also learned it in CS2. I believe I was able to carry my knowledge from CS2 to this topic in CS3

# **5 HARD TOPICS** 

## 1. Javascript Operations  
Since these operations were new, like if you add a float + an integer it would not give an integer value, if not a float, I had a hard time adjusting since most of the operations in C++ resulted in an integer. There were also new things like if you == a float and integer with the same value
it would come out as true. For example "2" == 2 is true.

## 2. Headers 
I believe headers were hard because we did not have those in C++. In java script you need to add different <> that have different functions. For example, you add your functions and computations in <script> while you add your website labels in <label>. 

## 3. Function Calling 
To be honest, even though we learned function calling in CS2, I never really used it in CS2. I always found another way using loops to do the coding tasks, and because of this, I dont really know how to properly use and call functions. However, I will try to learn it.

## 4. Javascript Syntax 
Since it is a new coding language, there are many differences in syntax from python to c++ to javascript. Though there are similarties, the new syntaxes took quite a while to get used to. However, the more I code, the better I will familiarize myself with these syntaxes.

## 5. Github
Since we never even used an outside website to code, github kinda messed me up. The commits, setting up your profile and all took some time to adjust to.

# **HOW TO MPROVE**
I believe you cannot improve instantly, but you can over time. By just doing the exercises, studying more about the syntaxes, and adjusting to the new coding platform, I believe this is how I can improve. Though it may not be fast, progress isnt linear, and sometimes you have to take one step back to go two steps forward.

# **EFFECTIVE ACTIVITIES IN CLASS**

## 1. Speed Tests
I believe the speed tests during class was very helpful to understanding more about JS. Since it tests out your knowledge about what was just discussed, you are kinda forced to listen to the lecture. Furthermore, it is incentivized with the person who answers first from your table getting bonus points.
I believe this was a really effective way of teaching.

## 2. Graded Exercises
I believe that like coding tasks, the graded exercises were the ones that really taught about JS. I had to find out syntaxes, and adjust to the new syntaxes, and because of these exercises, I am slowly but surely adjusting. Without these exercises, I dont think I would've been able to code in JS.
